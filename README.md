# Objected Conditions
* Object Oriented Conditions *

Objected Conditions is a library intending to allow us to make object oriented conditions (if/unless/else).

# Use

    (true == true).if do |r|
        "I am true"
    end.else do |r|
        "I am false"
    end

# Roadmap

* Convert it to a C ruby library
